# Changelog

All notable changes to ThinCoder VS Code are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-13

- Initial public release.

### Features

- Side-panel chat UI (`ctrl+alt+t` / `cmd+alt+t`) with full agent loop — multi-turn tool calling, parallel tool batching, subagents, plan mode, task tracking, long-term memory
- Sessions shared on-disk with the ThinCoder CLI (`~/.thincoder/sessions/`) — both ends read/write the same slots
- Provider config shared with the CLI (`~/.thincoder/config.json`) + in-panel settings UI with proxy support
- Tool approval mode: file-modifying tools require confirmation unless `thincoder.autoApprove` is on
- 20+ tools: file ops, bash, glob, grep, git, web fetch/search, checkpoints, read_image
- MCP client (stdio + HTTP transports)
- Zero npm runtime dependencies — pure Node.js standard library + VS Code API, no build step
